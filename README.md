# JPACRUDProject

### Overview
#### This is a full-stack Java Program, built from the ground up, from database to website. This program uses a table of foil fencing clubs in the United States, ranked by the sum of ranks of the fencers in that club according to fencingtracker.com. I wanted to create this website because fencingtracker.com does not tell you where the clubs are located, and you have to look up each club individually through a search engine to find out. I wanted to create a "one stop shop" club finder.
